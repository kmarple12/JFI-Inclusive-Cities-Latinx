latinx004,04arreola,,,Mexican American Housescapes,Daniel D. Arreola,1988,"The Mexican American housescape comprises a detached, single-family dwelling and its immediate surroundings in an urban barrio in the Southwest. The housescape is a complex of elements that includes property enclosure, exterior house color, and yard shrines. The housescape pattern indicates the most recent evolution of a historic landscape code that has linkages to pre-Columbian Mexico and Iberia. The persistence of the code is explained by the ease of accommodation to similar cultural circumstances over many generations.

latinx006,chicanopark,,,Event: Creation of Chicano Park ,Barrio Logan Neighborhood,1970,"This 7.4-acre underpass park is the result of a “takeover” by local residents who sought to create a public space below the on-ramp for the Coronado Bridge. The construction of the bridge and Interstate 5 in the 1960s necessitated the demolition of a swath of the Barrio Logan neighborhood, displacing some 5,000 people and disconnecting parts of the community. In 1970 activists occupied the land. Holding rallies and preparing to build a park themselves, they forced the city to set aside an initial 4.5 acres between Logan and National Avenues. The park became a significant epicenter of Chicano muralism, with approximately two-thirds of its more than 70 murals created between 1973 and 1989. The monumental murals, many painted on pillars supporting the bridge, are a contemporary offshoot of the Chicano Civil Rights Movement. Painted in vivid colors, the Aztec Revival style murals blend indigenous and Spanish heritage and represent various cultural icons from folklore, history, and everyday life.
