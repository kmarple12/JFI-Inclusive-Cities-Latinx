Arreola,1988,"The Mexican American housescape comprises a detached, single-family dwelling and its immediate surroundings in an urban barrio in the Southwest. The housescape is a complex of elements that includes property enclosure, exterior house color, and yard shrines. The housescape pattern indicates the most recent evolution of a historic landscape code that has linkages to pre-Columbian Mexico and Iberia. The persistence of the code is explained by the ease of accommodation to similar cultural circumstances over many generations.
